# Power Access Cloud

PAC (Power Access Cloud) is a self-service portal that offers Open Source developers, ISVs, and customers a catalog of Power Hardware resources for a limited time. It enables users to develop, test, and optimize software on Power Architecture. With PAC, users can browse the catalog and select the desired Power Hardware resources based on their requirements. This self-service model eliminates the need for approvals, reduces manual intervention, and removes infrastructure barriers.

PAC aims to foster collaboration, innovation, and adoption of Power Architecture, simplifying the exploration and development of Power-based applications from a comprehensive catalog of available resources.
